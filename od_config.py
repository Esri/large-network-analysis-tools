"""Defines OD Cost matrix solver object properties that are not specified
in the tool dialog.

A list of OD cost matrix solver properties is documented here:
https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/network-analyst/odcostmatrix.htm

You can include any of them in the dictionary in this file, and the tool will
use them. However, travelMode, timeUnits, distanceUnits, defaultImpedanceCutoff,
and defaultDestinationCount will be ignored because they are specified in the
tool dialog.
